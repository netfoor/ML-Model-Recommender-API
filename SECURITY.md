## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

## Security Best Practices

When using this API:

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for production use
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated, but ensure your use case is covered
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions

## Known Security Considerations

- This API does not implement authentication by default
- Input validation is basic - implement additional validation as needed
- Rate limiting is not implemented - consider adding this for production use
- Error messages may contain sensitive information - review for your use case

## Updates

Security updates will be communicated through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Email notifications to repository watchers
