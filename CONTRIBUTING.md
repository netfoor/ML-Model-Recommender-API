## Code Style Guidelines

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused

### Example:
```python
def recommend_model(task: str) -> dict:
    """
    Recommend the best model for a given task.
    
    Args:
        task: The task type (e.g., 'summarization', 'chat')
        
    Returns:
        dict: Model recommendation with cost and performance info
    """
    # Implementation here
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app

# Run specific test file
pytest test/test_recommender.py
```

### Writing Tests

    cost_input: 0.002
    cost_output: 0.003
    speed: fast
    tasks: [task1, task2]
```

2. **Add tests** in `test/test_recommender.py`

3. **Update documentation** with new supported models
